# Task-7-SQLite-With-Python

This project demonstrates how to use Python with SQLite to perform a basic sales data analysis. A small database (sales_data_new.db) was created containing a single sales table with product details, quantities, and prices. Using SQL queries within Python, total quantity and revenue for each product were calculated and displayed through Pandas. Finally, a simple bar chart was generated using Matplotlib to visualize product-wise revenue, showcasing integration of SQL and Python for data analysis.
